#  playing with APIs

This project is to show how simple it can be to start programming a web page to access an API

The project uses the javascript library JQUERY as taught at [w3schools JQuery Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/)

The API used is the [Singapore Carpark Availability API](https://data.gov.sg/datasets?formats=API&resultId=d_ca933a644e55d34fe21f28b8052fac63&page=1#tag/default/GET/transport/carpark-availability)

Which also uses the [HDB carpark list dataset](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_23f946fa557947f93a8043bbef41dd09/view?dataExplorerPage=1) which was downloaded to the csv file included here.

## Local development

There is a webserver in the root which serves files in the html directory.

For Windows there is a precompile `ws.exe`, for other platforms please compile the go project `webserverhere.go`
